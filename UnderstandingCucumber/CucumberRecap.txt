    Given, When, Then, And etc
    ONE DOCUMENT FOR ALL!

Cucumber -
      Support BDD
      A way to write test cases that
      ANYBODY(customers, testers, developers, client) can understand

  Advantages of Cucumber:
      --> Free!
      --> Inclusive
      --> Form reusable code ( Best deal we got)

  Cucumber Components :
          Feature file --> high level description of test Scenarios
                            in simple language
          Step Definitions --> Maps test case steps to code
                          (Converting feature file into code )

  JUnit (Help us run our code in a single place)
         CucumberRunner(CukesRunner)

         Step 1 : Create a class(CukesRunner)
         Step 2: @RunWith(Cucumber.class)annotation (Placed above class)
         Step 3: @CucumberOptions{
                      features: [Where the feature files are](start: src)
                      glue : [Where the step definitions are](start: com)
                          (start inside the java file(not including java file))
                      dryRun: [a test run to check if a method is missing]
                      tags: [group tests to run]
                      plugin: [additional features]

         }
